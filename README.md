# Launched on Space X Falcon 9 on 2.15.2024 from Kennedy Space Center
# Landed on Moon South Pole on 2.22.2024 
# Location: Malapert Latitude Longitude Diameter A 80.13°S 1.44°E
# Estimated $7.0+ Billion in RWA ( Real World Assets, Art, Music Catalogs, A List Brands and Bitcoin Projects) have their twin digital and metalic and bitcoin inscribed assets installed in the Lunaprise Museum.

Galactic Legacy Labs along with its partners Space Blue and the Arch Mission Foundation ("AMF") made international headlines and history by sending human creativity to the lunar surface. Space Blue oversaw the final curation of the 222 art projects at the Lunaprise Museum compiling the final list of artwork, and artists and developing the certification processes for all artwork involved. The Lunaprise archive includes artists curated in the Lunar Art Archive, a project steered by AMF. The Lunaprise was attached to the Odesseyus Lunar Lander which landed on the Moon on February 22nd of 2024. For the first time in over 50 years, NASA and the United States landed on the Moon, and this time with the Lunaprise, it was with a historic human and artistic timestamp of past and present, lasting in space for over 1 billion years.
The landing site is within proximity of where NASA's Artemis mission is planning to send humans to land there and build a colony on the south pole region of the moon.

GitHub USE: The purpose of the Lunaprise archive and depository in Github is to deposit and provide the public worldwide access to important information from the Lunaprise Time Capsule and Moon-based Lunar Museum, along with important descriptive information about the project.

# A failed attempt by another spacecraft not involving Lunaprise resulted in Bitcoin burning up in failed spacecraft.

Another mission attempted to send actual bitcoin to the moon aboard the Astrobotic Peregrine mission in January 2024, but the spacecraft had a fuel leak on the way to the moon, sending the payload ( including the bitcoin) to crash back and burn up in the atmosphere, leaving Space Blue and the Lunaprise museum 2months later in February 2024 as the first project to successfully land bitcoin art and bitcoin white paper and bitcoin projects stowed inside of the Lunaprise time capsule.BitMEX had announced previously their plans, one large step for Bitcoin but it failed. The crypto exchange had previously announced plans to deposit a physical wallet containing a single bitcoin on the surface of the moon. The wallet was in the form of a commemorative coin but was presumed burnt up over the Pacific ocean.

# Space Mission Overview:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a81db917-9381-4212-805e-00d5392e50fc)

The Odysseus lunar lander was the first commercial lunar lander to land on the moon, making history in February 2024. The lander was part of the IM-1 mission, a collaboration between Intuitive Machines and NASA's CLPS program. The mission's scientific objectives included:
Studying radio astronomy, plume-surface interactions, and space weather interactions with the lunar surface
Demonstrating communication and navigation node capabilities
Demonstrating precision landing technologies 

The Lunaprise Archive and art museum was bolted to the Odessyus lander and contained a series of 18 metallic and nanofiche discs which store the content as both tiff image files inscribed onto the discs and a digital archive of mp4 and mp3 files. No battery or other power was required for the lunaprise payload assuring its success regardless if the lander tipped over or even crashed 
 
The Lander's Mission ended after it landed sideways near the moon's south pole and lost power during a lunar nightfall. The Lander's final image was sent on February 22, and it will remain inoperable on the Moon's surface. 
 
Here are some other notable things about the Odysseus mission: 
 
The mission was hailed as a success by NASA and Intuitive Machines, despite some problems. 
 
The Lander's weak signal while phoning home raised questions about its orientation and health. 

222 art projects in the Lunaprise spanning over 30,000 years of human history set hundreds of space archives and art history records.
 
The mission marked the first US Moon landing in over 50 years.

LUNAPRISE IS LANDED ON MOON'S SOUTH POLE- THE PROXIMITY OF FUTURE PLANNED NASA ARTEMIS MISSIONS TO THE SOUTH POLE OF MOON.
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3ce0cba-127c-484d-a2e3-c3b59ee87649)


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_south_pole#/media/File:Full_Moon_with_south_polar_markings.jpg

As NASA prepares to send astronauts back to the Moon under Artemis, the agency has identified 13 candidate landing regions, each within proximity of the Lunaprise archives,  near the lunar South Pole. Each region contains multiple potential landing sites for Artemis III, which will be the first of the Artemis missions to bring crew to the lunar surface, including the first woman to set foot on the Moon.
https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-identifies-candidate-regions-for-landing-next-americans-on-moon/

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4b9d54c-67ad-426a-9744-432db0322695)

Each of these regions is located within six degrees of latitude of the lunar South Pole and, collectively, contains diverse geologic features. Together, the regions provide landing options for all potential Artemis III launch opportunities. Specific landing sites are tightly coupled to the timing of the launch window, so multiple regions ensure flexibility to launch throughout the year.

To select the regions, an agency-wide team of scientists and engineers assessed the area near the lunar South Pole using data from NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and decades of publications and lunar science findings. In addition to considering launch window availability, the team evaluated regions based on their ability to accommodate a safe landing, using criteria including terrain slope, ease of communications with Earth, and lighting conditions. To determine accessibility, the team also considered the combined capabilities of the Space Launch System rocket, the Orion spacecraft, and the SpaceX-provided Starship human landing system.


## Lunaprise  COSPAR ID: 2024- 030A

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3fb46ec7-9ac2-4b51-a5f4-9e5336fb88b1)

https://spaceartefacts.com/human-objects-on-the-moon

COSPAR ID: Stands for ‘Committee on Space Research Identifier’. It is an international number assigned to man-made objects launched in space. It consists of the launch year, a three-digit incrementing launch number of that year, and a letter code to distinguish objects between them. Only successful launches are given a COSPAR ID.

Name: Official name of the object. In the case of small objects, their type names are used. A ‘plus’ sign is used when several objects are still fixed together. Information in brackets are either engine names, serials or references.

type: Object type. In the case of small objects, it is identical to its name.

Mission: Official name of the mission with alternate known mission names in brackets.
