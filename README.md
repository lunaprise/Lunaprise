Galactic Legacy Labs along with its partners Space Blue and the Arch Mission Foundation
made international headlines and history by sending human creativity to the lunar surface as Space Blue oversaw the curation of the 222 art projects on the Lunaprise Museum. The Lunaprise was attached to the Odesseyus Lunar Lander which landed on the Moon on February 22nd of 2024.  For the first time in over 50 years, NASA and the United States landed on the moon, and this time with the Lunaprise, it was with a historic human and artistic timestamp of past and present, lasting in space for over 1 billion years.

## Space Mission Overview

The Odysseus lunar lander was the first commercial lunar lander to land on the moon, making history in February 2024. The lander was part of the IM-1 mission, a collaboration between Intuitive Machines and NASA's CLPS program. The mission's scientific objectives included:
Studying radio astronomy, plume-surface interactions, and space weather interactions with the lunar surface
Demonstrating communication and navigation node capabilities
Demonstrating precision landing technologies 

The lunaprise archive and art museum was bolted to the Odessyus lander and contained a series of 18 metallic and nanofiche discs which stores the content as both tiff image files inscribed onto the discs and a digital archive of mp4 and mp3 files. No battery or other power was required for the lunaprise payload assuring it's success regardless if the lander tipped over or even crashed 
 
The lander's mission ended after it landed sideways near the moon's south pole and lost power during a lunar nightfall. The lander's final image was sent on February 22, and it will remain inoperable on the moon's surface. 
 
Here are some other notable things about the Odysseus mission: 
 
The mission was hailed as a success by NASA and Intuitive Machines, despite some problems. 
 
The lander's weak signal while phoning home raised questions about its orientation and health. 

222 art projects in the Lunaprise spsnking over 30,000 years of human history set hundreds of space archive and art history records 
 
The mission marked the first US moon landing in over 50 years.
