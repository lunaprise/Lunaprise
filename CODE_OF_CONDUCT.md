# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our project unwelcoming for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- **No contributions**: We believe that the best way to maintain the integrity of our project is by not accepting any contributions. This ensures that the original vision and code remain untouched.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- **Attempting to contribute**: Any form of contribution, be it code, documentation, or suggestions, is strictly prohibited.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

To make clear the project's stance:

- **No contributions will be accepted**: Any pull requests, issues, or other forms of contributions will be automatically closed without review.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Given our stance, this essentially means:

- **No public or private contributions**: This includes, but is not limited to, GitHub issues, pull requests, emails, and any other form of communication.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [insert contact method]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a decision in favor of not accepting contributions.

**Enforcement Guidelines**:

- **Immediate closure**: Any contribution attempt will be immediately closed without further action.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), a standard for maintaining healthy and welcoming open source communities, but modified to reflect our unique approach of not accepting contributions.

---

This code of conduct, while adhering to the structure of the Contributor Covenant, effectively communicates that no contributions are allowed, which might be interpreted as an extreme way to ensure project integrity or maintain a very specific vision.
