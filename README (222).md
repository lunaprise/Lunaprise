Galactic Legacy Labs along with its partners Space Blue and the Arch Mission Foundation
made international headlines and history by sending human creativity to the lunar surface as Space Blue oversaw the curation of the 222 art projects on the Lunaprise Museum. The Lunaprise was attached to the Odesseyus Lunar Lander which landed on the Moon on February 22nd of 2024.  For the first time in over 50 years, NASA and the United States landed on the moon, and this time with the Lunaprise, it was with a historic human and artistic timestamp of past and present, lasting in space for over 1 billion years.
